## Todo:

- JWTs are only valid per session
- Ensure proper handling of replacing "/" in zoom meetingUUIDs with "\_" but saving all files with the untouched meetingUUID
- Postgres
- EntraID
- Auto scroll should allow downward scrolling
- reimplement denoising with new solution

## Inprovements:

- IaC for datacrunch GPU server based on zoom meeting calender?
- Auto fine tuning?
