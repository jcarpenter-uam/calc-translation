# Infrastructure and Dependency Management Policy

**App:** Zoom Translator  
**Maintainer:** Jonah Carpenter  
**Last Updated:** October 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose
This policy defines how the Zoom Translator appâ€™s infrastructure and dependencies are managed and secured.  
The objective is to maintain a secure, stable, and controlled environment for the appâ€™s internal use within the organization.

---

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to:
- The infrastructure used to host, deploy, and operate the Zoom Translator app.  
- All third-party libraries, APIs, SDKs, and frameworks integrated into the application.

---

## 3. Infrastructure Security

### 3.1. Hosting Environment
- The app is hosted in a secure, organization-controlled environment with access limited to the developer.  
- Hosting providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, or internal servers) must enforce:
  - Strong authentication (MFA required)  
  - HTTPS/TLS encryption for all network communication  
  - Firewall and access control configurations that restrict unauthorized access

### 3.2. Data Protection
- Meeting data and translation logs are stored in organization-managed storage only.  
- All sensitive data in transit is protected using SSL/TLS.  
- No personal data is transmitted to or stored by external third-party services without authorization.

### 3.3. Access Management
- Access to infrastructure components (servers, databases, build pipelines) is limited to the authorized developer account.  
- SSH keys, API tokens, and credentials are stored securely using environment variables or encrypted configuration files.  
- Access logs are retained and periodically reviewed for anomalies.

### 3.4. Backups & Recovery
- Critical data (transcripts, configuration files) is backed up periodically to secure internal storage.  
- Backups are encrypted and can be restored manually in case of data loss or corruption.

## 4. Dependency Management

### 4.1. Approved Dependencies
- Only well-maintained and trusted open-source packages are used.  
- Dependencies must come from official repositories (e.g., npm, PyPI, etc.).  
- Deprecated or unmaintained libraries are replaced as needed.

### 4.2. Vulnerability Management
- Dependencies are checked for known vulnerabilities using built-in tools such as:
  - `npm audit` (for Node.js-based components)  
  - `pip-audit` or similar tools (for Python-based components)
- Vulnerability checks are performed periodically and whenever new dependencies are added.

### 4.3. Version Control
- Dependency versions are pinned (via `package-lock.json` or equivalent) to ensure build consistency.  
- Updates are tested in a development environment before deployment to production.

### 4.4. Third-Party Integrations
- External APIs (e.g., Zoom SDK, translation APIs) are used only with approved credentials.  
- API scopes and permissions are limited to the minimum necessary for the appâ€™s functionality.

---

## 5. Change and Deployment Management
- All infrastructure and dependency changes are committed to version control.  
- Deployments are performed manually or through a controlled CI/CD pipeline.  
- Deployment logs and build histories are retained for traceability.

---

## 6. Policy Review and Maintenance
This policy is reviewed periodically to ensure it remains aligned with current infrastructure and dependency management practices.  
Updates are documented within the repository and reviewed by the developer.
