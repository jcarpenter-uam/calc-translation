# Security Policy

**App:** Zoom Translator  
**Maintainer:** Jonah Carpenter  
**Last Updated:** October 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose
This Security Policy defines the security objectives, principles, and responsibilities that guide the development and operation of the **Zoom Translator** app.  
The purpose is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of internal data while maintaining a secure environment for internal users.

---

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all aspects of the Zoom Translator app, including its source code, infrastructure, and data handling processes.  
As this is an **internal-use-only** tool developed and maintained by a single developer, security practices are scaled to fit the appâ€™s limited exposure and use.

---

## 3. Security Objectives
- **Confidentiality:** Protect internal meeting data and user information from unauthorized access.  
- **Integrity:** Ensure that code, data, and translations are accurate and free from unauthorized modification.  
- **Availability:** Maintain reliable access to the app for authorized internal users.

---

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Developer**  
  - Responsible for implementing, maintaining, and reviewing security practices.  
  - Ensures secure handling of credentials, configuration files, and sensitive data.  
  - Monitors dependency and platform updates to address known vulnerabilities.  

---

## 5. Data Security
- Sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens) are stored in environment variables or secure configuration files, never in source code.  
- Data in transit is protected using HTTPS/TLS.  
- Internal meeting transcripts and related data are stored securely within organization-controlled systems.  
- Access to the application and stored data is restricted to authorized users only.

---

## 6. Secure Development Practices
- Security considerations are included during the design and development of all new features.  
- Dependencies are reviewed periodically for vulnerabilities.  
- Environment variables and configuration files are secured with appropriate permissions.  
- Regular commits ensure transparency and version tracking through GitHub.

---

## 7. Incident Response
- Any suspected security incidents (e.g., data leaks, unauthorized access) are investigated immediately.  
- Access tokens or credentials found compromised are revoked and regenerated.  
- Logs are reviewed to determine root causes and implement mitigations.

---

## 8. Policy Maintenance
This policy is reviewed periodically to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness.  
Revisions may be made as the application evolves or if new security requirements are introduced by Zoom or related integrations.
