**App:** Zoom Translator  
**Maintainer:** Jonah Carpenter  
**Last Updated:** October 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose
This policy outlines the process for identifying, responding to, and resolving security incidents involving the Zoom Translator app.  
Its goal is to minimize damage, recover quickly, and prevent recurrence in the event of a security breach or data exposure.

---

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all systems, components, and data related to the Zoom Translator app, including the development environment, internal deployment, and stored meeting data.  
Although the app is for **internal use only**, incidents are treated seriously to protect internal users and maintain data confidentiality.

---

## 3. Definitions
- **Security Incident:** Any event that compromises or has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the app or its data.  
  Examples include unauthorized access, data leaks, system misuse, or exposure of credentials.  
- **Incident Response:** The structured approach used to manage and mitigate such incidents.

---

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Developer**  
  - Responsible for detecting, investigating, documenting, and mitigating all security incidents.  
  - Coordinates communication with internal stakeholders and, if required, with Zoom Security.  
  - Maintains logs and documentation of all incident-related activities.

## 5. Incident Response Process

### 5.1. Detection
- Monitor logs and system behavior for unusual access patterns, unexpected errors, or unauthorized requests.  
- Be alert for security alerts from hosting providers, GitHub, or third-party integrations.

### 5.2. Containment
- Immediately disable compromised accounts, tokens, or integrations.  
- Revoke or rotate any exposed credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.).  
- If applicable, isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further damage.

### 5.3. Investigation
- Review logs to identify the cause, impact, and entry point of the incident.  
- Determine what data or systems were accessed or affected.  
- Document findings, including timeline, root cause, and systems involved.

### 5.4. Eradication
- Remove malicious files, unauthorized access points, or corrupted data.  
- Patch vulnerabilities or update dependencies that contributed to the incident.

### 5.5. Recovery
- Restore systems from clean backups if necessary.  
- Validate the integrity of code and configurations before bringing systems back online.  
- Resume normal operations once confirmed stable and secure.

### 5.6. Notification
- If the incident involves exposure of internal user data or Zoom integration data:
  - Notify affected internal users and stakeholders.  
  - Notify Zoomâ€™s Security team if Zoom user data, API credentials, or tokens were involved.  
  - Provide a summary of impact, containment steps, and mitigation actions.

### 5.7. Post-Incident Review
- Conduct a retrospective to identify lessons learned.  
- Update documentation and policies as needed.  
- Implement additional safeguards to prevent recurrence.

---

## 6. Recordkeeping
- All incidents and actions taken are logged and stored securely in internal documentation.  
- Logs should include timestamps, nature of incident, affected systems, response actions, and resolution summary.

---

## 7. Policy Maintenance
This policy is reviewed annually or after any significant incident.  
Updates are documented in the repository and communicated through internal channels.
