Privacy Policy (Internal Use Only) 

Effective Date: October 2025 

This Privacy Policy applies to the internal use of the Zoom Translator app, developed and maintained by Jonah Carpenter. 

This App is intended solely for internal operational purposes and is not distributed publicly. 

 

1. Purpose 

The App enables real-time translation during Zoom meetings for internal staff. 

It is designed to improve communication within the organizational meetings where language barriers are found 

 

2. Information We Process 

Audio Data: Temporary audio streams from Zoom meetings are processed in real time to generate translations and transcriptions. 

Translation Text: Generated transcriptions and translations are displayed for the user to follow along with the meeting in real time 

User Identifiers: Basic user identifiers (e.g., meeting participant name or ID) are used to identify the speaker at any given moment within the meeting 

 

3. Data Retention 

The App stores personal data in the form of final meeting transcripts which comes with timestamps and speaker names per sentence 

 

4. Access Control 

Access to the App is restricted to authorized Zoom accounts within the organization that have been granted access via the application installation link. 

Anyone with a shared meeting link or the meeting credentials may also view the live translation feed for transparency during meetings. 

 

5. Data Sharing 

No personal or meeting data is shared with third parties. 

Any integrations (e.g., translation APIs) are used under internal enterprise agreements or with approved service providers. 

 

6. Security 

Reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards are in place to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access or disclosure. 

 

7. Changes to this Policy 

This policy may be updated periodically to reflect operational or compliance changes.
