# Privacy Policy (Internal Use Only)

**Effective Date:** October 2025

This Privacy Policy applies to the internal use of the Zoom Translator app, developed and maintained by Jonah Carpenter.  
This App is intended solely for internal operational purposes and is not distributed publicly.

---

## 1. Purpose
The App enables real-time translation during Zoom meetings for internal staff.  
It is designed to improve communication within the organization and is not used for external customers or public services.

---

## 2. Information We Process
- **Audio Data:** Temporary audio streams from Zoom meetings may be processed in real time to generate translations. These streams may also be stored temporarily for internal distribution or debugging purposes.  
- **Translation Text:** Generated translations may be displayed in real time and logged internally for distribution to meeting attendees.  
- **User Identifiers:** Basic user identifiers (e.g., meeting participant name or ID) are stored as part of the final transcript and used for displaying speaker information on the frontend.

---

## 3. Data Retention
The App stores personal data in the form of meeting transcripts and, in some cases, audio recordings.  
This data is used solely to generate and distribute final meeting transcripts to attendees and to support debugging or audio quality improvements.

---

## 4. Access Control
Access to the App is restricted to authorized Zoom accounts that have been granted access via the application installation link.  
Anyone with the shared meeting link may view the live translation feed for transparency during meetings.

---

## 5. Data Sharing
No personal or meeting data is shared with third parties.  
Any integrations (e.g., translation APIs) are used under internal enterprise agreements or with approved service providers.

---

## 6. Security
Reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards are in place to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access or disclosure.

---

## 7. Changes to this Policy
This policy may be updated periodically to reflect operational or compliance changes.  
All internal users will be notified of updates through official communication channels.

---

## 8. Contact
For questions or concerns regarding this policy or the App, please contact the developer.
