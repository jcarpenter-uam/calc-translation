# Before this branch can be merged

- Multi-tenant EntraID flow
- Per user JWT, replace "TEST_USER" with the real user
- Protect backend routes
- Test adding zoom app per user
- Clean up slop
- Admin page to manage tenants
- Leave the door open for SSO URLs in a future update
- Test integration option on frontend should only show up and work for admins
- Redo UX
- Reduce ENV vars when possible

# Once finished

This should be a fully functional, production ready v1.1.2 update besides the desktop application which will be the next step.
Remember the future functionality of reading calenders, SSO URL auth, complete admin dashboard with API usages should be accounted for although not yet implemented.
