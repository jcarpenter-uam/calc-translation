- Fix WS connection speed (could be due to this specific meeting used for testing)
- There is still an edge case where a utterance can go missing depending on when the new connection is started. This is usually only for shorter sentences
- only fetch meeting info from api if !database
- duplicate logs for each language
- Backfill rate limiting
