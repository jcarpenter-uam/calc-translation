# Before this branch can be merged

- Backend redirects to frontend
- Centralize SQL queries
- Redo UX
- Reduce ENV vars when possible, reduce duplicate checks

# Once finished

This should be a fully functional, production ready v1.1.2 update besides the desktop application which will be the next step.
Remember the future functionality of reading calenders, SSO URL auth, complete admin dashboard with API usages should be accounted for although not yet implemented.
